A C HL7 message library, for Linux. It's written in a somewhat OO fashion, using structures and function pointers to simulate objects - as well as providing iterators for the objects to allow one to safely traverse the messages.

It will have both a client and server, using basic TCP sockets.

It has been tested on Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10, 9.04, and AntiX (Mepis) 8. (All Debian-based distributions of Linux.)

If you find any bugs or have suggestions, please feel free to drop me a line.

There is also a C++ version located [here](http://code.google.com/p/hl7libpp/).
